# Multi-Task Model Training with Keras

This repository provides a step-by-step guide on creating and training a multi-task model using Keras. The project is structured into several tasks, allowing you to grasp each concept progressively. As you follow along, you will be provided with a cloud desktop environment with all the necessary software pre-installed, enabling you to actively engage in hands-on learning.

## Project Tasks:

### Task 1: Introduction
- Overview of the project and its objectives.
- Introduction to multi-task learning with Keras.

### Task 2: Create Dataset
- Explanation of the dataset used for training the multi-task model.
- Guidelines on preparing and organizing the data.

### Task 3: Dataset Generator
- Implementation of a dataset generator function.
- Hands-on demonstration of creating a generator for efficient data handling.

### Task 4: Create Model
- Designing the architecture of the multi-task model using Keras.
- Explanation of the chosen model architecture and its components.

### Task 5: Train the Model
- Guidance on training the multi-task model using the prepared dataset.
- Monitoring and analyzing the training process.

### Task 6: Final Predictions
- Applying the trained model to make predictions on new data.
- Evaluation of model performance and final insights.
